# zsh-starterkit

zsh is wonderful. But the defaults aren't that great for a new user. This
project builds on the simplicity of oh-my-zsh by giving you a great base
install with some essential plugins.

If you are a well seasoned shell aficionado, this project might not be for you.
But if you like projects like oh-my-zsh and want something better than bash
without having to spend your life learning to configure your shell, this project
pulls in all the best stuff to get you started with minimal setup.

Better living via better zsh defaults - that's zsh-starterkit.

## #Plugins
